# MyWork
A detailed description of the work can be found within the notebooks. As all files are orginially linked to my Kaggle account, I'd recommend opening them in Kaggle
to get access to the used data. Some are codes from Kaggle competitions while others are just personal projects I try doing to enhance my learning.
