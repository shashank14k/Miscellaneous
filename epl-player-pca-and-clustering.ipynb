It varied from -10 to 20 for PC2. This observation is in accordance with the PCA theory. As latter components explain less variation, the data-points are concentrated in a narrower range. This also results in inefficient clustering. The reduction in elbow score from a single cluster to 3 clusters is quite less compared to PC1 and PC2.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Combining PC1 and PC2\nFinally, let's see how the first two principal components, in combination, cluster the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"kmeans_scores(pc,12,1,2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T18:23:19.331435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T18:23:19.331747Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T18:23:20.172819Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T18:23:19.331717Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T18:23:20.171852Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"4 clusters seem to be the right choice here","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"kmeans=KMeans(4)\nl=kmeans.fit_predict(pc[::,:2])\ncen=kmeans.cluster_centers_\ndf['pc1']=pc.T[0]\ndf['pc2']=pc.T[1]\ndf['cluster']=l","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T18:24:47.716038Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T18:24:47.71634Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T18:24:47.768288Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T18:24:47.716305Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T18:24:47.767707Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.relplot(data=df, x='pc1', y='pc2', hue='cluster', palette='tab10', kind='scatter',height=8.27, aspect=11.7/8.27)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T18:25:06.783547Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T18:25:06.783849Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T18:25:07.342552Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T18:25:06.783816Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T18:25:07.341747Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pos=[['GK','DF'],['MF','FW']]\nf,ax=plt.subplots(2,2,figsize=(20,10))\nfor i in range(0,2):\n    for j in range(0,2):\n        r=df[df['Primary_pos']==pos[i][j]]\n        sns.scatterplot(ax=ax[i,j],data=r, x='pc1', y='pc2', hue='cluster', palette='tab10',s=40)\n        ax[i][j].set_title(pos[i][j],size=15)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T18:38:21.537373Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T18:38:21.537691Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T18:38:22.794844Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T18:38:21.537644Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T18:38:22.793967Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Remember that PC1 is associated with attacking output (goals,assists etc) while PC2 is associated with ball progression and involvement in attacking third. Based on this, let's analyze the four clusters. Below, I have created a function to see the names belonging to each cluster.\n\n**Cluster 0**\n1. All players in this cluster have negative values for both PC1 and PC2\n2. These are mainly defensive players. All goalkeepers, hence, quite undestandably belong to this cluster. Rest of this cluster comprises mainly of defenders, and a few midfilders who I believe must be the ones responsible for screening the back line.\n\n**Cluster 1**\n1. Positive values for both PC1 and PC2\n2. This cluster mainly includes midfilders and forwards. There are only 3 defenders in this clusters. They must be the modern highly active full-backs who shuttle up and down the flank providing assistance in the attacking third. \n3. Players in this cluster are perhaps the cheif creators in their teams. Mohamed Salah, Trent, Bruno Fernandes etc fall in this cluster.\n\n**Cluster 2**\n1. Positive PC1 but negative PC2\n2. These are players who have good attacking numbers (maybe not as good as the ones in cluster 1), but aren't involved a lot in the build up play in the attacking half. As it mainly includes forwards, I belive these are typical goalpoachers.\n\n**Cluster 3**\n1. Negative PC1 but postive PC2\n2. Highly active players who cover a lot of distance and progress the ball, but don't have hight attacking numbers. Mainly composed of defenders and midfielders like Henderson,Fabinho, Declan Rice etc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def player_cluster(pos,cl,df):\n    db=df.groupby('cluster').get_group(cl)\n    return db[db['Primary_pos']==pos]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T19:22:07.423474Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T19:22:07.423799Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T19:22:07.429416Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T19:22:07.423762Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T19:22:07.4286Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"db=player_cluster('MF',1,df)\ndb","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T19:22:25.954697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T19:22:25.954988Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T19:22:25.996067Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T19:22:25.954957Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T19:22:25.995375Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
